Hi, I’m **Dr. Metehan Güzelkaya** — a medical doctor and **Family Medicine Resident Physician** at **Ankara Training and Research Hospital (Health Sciences University, Türkiye)**. My clinical work and field experience—often in **frontier/border and resource-constrained settings**—shape a practical, prevention-oriented approach to primary care.

My interests sit at the intersection of **primary care**, **public health**, and **data-driven research**. I work on topics spanning **infectious disease surveillance**, **environmental and exposome-related health risks**, and **community-based interventions**, with a focus on translating real-world evidence into usable tools for frontline practice.

Methodologically, I enjoy building and stress-testing research workflows: **study design**, **measurement**, and **statistical modeling** (especially in **R** and **SPSS**). Recently, I’ve been increasingly engaged in **mathematical and computational thinking** for health research—particularly around **modeling motivation and behavior change dynamics** and making complex concepts operational for applied clinical contexts.
